# To contribute improvements to CI/CD templates, please follow the Development guide at:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cicd/templates.html
# This specific template is located at:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/dotNET.gitlab-ci.yml

# The following script will work for any project that can be built from command line by msbuild
# It uses powershell shell executor, so you need to add the following line to your config.toml file
# (located in gitlab-runner.exe directory):
#   shell = "powershell"
#
# The script is composed of 3 stages: build, test and deploy.
#
# The build stage restores NuGet packages and uses msbuild to build the exe and msi
# One major issue you'll find is that you can't build msi projects from command line
# if you use vdproj.  There are workarounds building msi via devenv, but they rarely work
# The best solution is migrating your vdproj projects to WiX, as it can be build directly
# by msbuild.
#
# The test stage runs nunit from command line against Test project inside your solution
# It also saves the resulting TestResult.xml file
#
# The deploy stage copies the exe and msi from build stage to a network drive
# You need to have the network drive mapped as Local System user for gitlab-runner service to see it
# The best way to persist the mapping is via a scheduled task
# running the following batch command: net use P: \\x.x.x.x\Projects /u:your_user your_pass /persistent:yes
#
# You can copy and paste this template into a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
# You should not add this template to an existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by using the `include:` keyword.
